# Game play
## A turn consists of either:
- Taking a lift
- Skiing a piste
When you take a lift, you must first pick a random card in the Game section on the left.
You finish your go either at the top or the bottom of a ski piste.
You cannot ski down a piste that is closed.
Every time you ski a piste, tally a mark in the appropriate piste colour section in the Piste Tally column.
         
## Ski Level
Every player starts at blue level. This means they can *only* ski down blue pistes.
After skiing a green or blue piste 5 times, this player is now red level and can now also ski down red pistes.
After skiing a red piste 5 times, this player is now black level and can now also ski down black pistes.
A played can never level down, but may level up from game cards.
Every time you ski a piste, take a tally in the Piste Tally column next to the colour you have skied.

## Wining points
There are 3 types of points in the game.
- Piste Points:
Tally each piste you ski throughout the game in the correct section.
At the end of the game, count up each coloured section.
Blue/Green pistes = 2 points each;
Red pistes = 3 points each;
Black pistes = 5 points each
- Lift Points:
Tally each lift you take from your Lift List.
At the end of the game, each lift you take from your list is worth 5 points.
- Card Points:
You may receive points throughout the game from cards you pick up before taking a lift.
